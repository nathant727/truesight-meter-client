# truesight-meter-client

A java library for interacting with the TrueSight Pulse meter.

# Motivation

Primarily this library was developed to provide a way to ship dropwizard metrics from a java process into the Pulse backend.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

By default it is expected that a meter process is running locally.

## Maven

```xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.bmc.truesight.saas</groupId>
        <artifactId>meter-client</artifactId>
        <version>0.7</version>
    </dependency>
```

# Usage

## Create the client

```java
        TruesightMeterRpcClientConfig config = new TruesightMeterRpcClientConfig();
        // set config values if you are running the meter on non-standard host/port
        TruesightMeterRpcClient client = new TruesightMeterRpcClient(config);
        client.connect();
```

## Add Measurements

```java
        Measure measure = Measure.of("my-measurement", 2.3);
        client.addMeasure(measure);
```
